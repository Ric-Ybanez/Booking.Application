# Booking.Application

# INTRODUCTION
Thank you for your interest in Integrated Cloud Products Ltd.
We want a transparent recruitment process and this introduction aims to explain what we
expect from successful candidates, while making the process as smooth as possible for you
and the Company.
The first stage of the recruitment process is to complete an assessment, detailed below, to
evaluate your skills and knowledge. The aim of the assessment is for you to demonstrate the
quality of code you are able to write.
You can spend as much or as little time on the assessment as you like; your level of
experience may dictate how long it will take you to produce sufficient examples of coding.
An explanation of the Requirement Levels, detailed below, should help you gauge what level
of experience you would like to demonstrate in your assessment.
The assessment will give you an insight into the type of exciting and innovative technology
we use at ICP, and you will have the opportunity to develop .NET MVC skills which will
enhance your career. If you find this assessment appealing and interesting, then you might
be the right fit for the company!
If your assessment satisfies the skills and criteria necessary for the position, the second
stage will be an interview with the Head of Development to discuss your project in further
detail.
If the outcome of the interview is positive, the third stage will be a meeting with the CEO of
the Company, from there, we may move to offer.
